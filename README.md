  <h4>Based Upon Phoenix Firmware Dumper from DroidDumps, with some Changes and Improvements</h4>

</div>


## What this really is

You might've used firmware extractor via dumpyara from https://github.com/AndroidDumps/. This toolkit is revamped edition of the tools with some improvements and feature additions.

## The improvements over dumpyara

- [x] dumpyara's and firmware_extractor's scripts are merged with handpicked shellcheck-ed and pylint-ed improvements
- [x] The script can download and dump firmware from different filehosters such as Mega.NZ, Mediafire.com, AndroidFileHost.com and from Google Drive URLs
- [x] File as-well-as Folder as an input is processed thoroughly to check all kinds of supported firmware types
- [x] All the external tools are now inherited into one place and unnesessary files removed
- [x] Binary tools are updated to latest available source
- [x] LG KDZ utilities are updated to support latest firmwares
- [x] Installation requirements are narrowed down to minimal for playing with this toolkit
- [x] Recovery Dump is made too

## Recommendations before Playing with Firmware Dumper

This toolkit can run in any Debian/Ubuntu distribution, Ubuntu Bionic and Focal would be best, other versions are not tested.

Support for Alpine Linux is added and tested. You can give it a try.

For any other UNIX Distributions, the internal setup routine detects the package manager and installs the required programs via its own package manager.

## Prepare toolkit dependencies / requirements

DumprX is a Python package managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
Setup is a single step:

```bash
uv run dumprx --setup
```

`--setup` installs system-level binaries (7zz, simg2img, aria2c, etc.), the
`uv` tool, runtime helper tools, and Python dependencies. It records a state
file on success. On any later run without `--setup`, DumprX re-runs setup
automatically if that state file is missing or incomplete. Use `--no-setup`
to skip that auto-run (for scripts/CI).

To install the Python tool with uv only:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Usage

Run this toolkit with proper firmware file/folder path or URL:

```bash
uv run dumprx 'Firmware File/Extracted Folder -OR- Supported Website Link'
```

Useful flags:

```bash
uv run dumprx --local firmware.bin          # extract + README, no push (recommended first run)
uv run dumprx --readme-only                 # regenerate README.md from existing OUTDIR
uv run dumprx --push-only 'link-or-folder'  # skip extraction, push existing OUTDIR
uv run dumprx -o /data/dumps firmware.bin   # write output under /data/dumps instead of /tmp/out
uv run dumprx --setup                       # install prerequisites and record setup state
uv run dumprx --no-setup firmware.bin       # skip the auto-run setup check
uv run dumprx --github --public firmware.bin
uv run dumprx --help
```

Mode defaults to `gitlab` (matches the legacy Bash dumper defaults), and repos are
created private unless `--public` is given.

Help Context:

## How to use it to Upload the Dump to GitLab

To automatically push your firmware dumps to a GitLab repository (default mode) and receive Telegram notifications:

1. Copy the environment template to create your config file:
   ```bash
   cp .dumprxenv.example .dumprxenv
   ```
2. Open `.dumprxenv` and fill in your credentials/configurations:
   - `GITLAB_TOKEN`: Your personal GitLab access token.
   - `GITLAB_INSTANCE`: The GitLab host domain (defaults to `gitlab.com`).
   - `GITLAB_GROUP`: Optional GitLab group/organization name. If left blank, your username will be used.
   - `TG_TOKEN`: Optional Telegram bot token to send status messages.
   - `TG_CHAT`: Optional Telegram chat/channel ID (defaults to `@DumprXDumps`).

## How to use it to Upload the Dump to GitHub

GitHub mode works like GitLab mode but pushes to github.com instead:

1. In `.dumprxenv`, set:
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub personal access token (fine-grained or classic PAT) used to create the repo via the GitHub API.
   - `GITHUB_ORG`: Optional GitHub organization name. If left blank, your personal account is used.
2. Make sure your SSH key is registered on GitHub, since the dump is pushed over SSH like GitLab.
   Files larger than 50 MB are automatically pushed via Git LFS (GitHub's recommended limit),
   so you may need `git-lfs` installed.
3. Run with the github mode:
   ```bash
   uv run dumprx --github <firmware-file-or-url>
   # or
   uv run dumprx --mode github --public <firmware-file-or-url>
   ```

> GitHub has no nested namespaces, so a dump that GitLab would store as
> `group/manufacturer/codename` is created here as a single repo named after the
> codename with a `_dump` suffix, keeping its original casing (e.g.
> `Infinix-X6878_dump`) under `GITHUB_ORG` or your personal account.

### Via CI (GitHub Actions)

The `dump` workflow has a **target** input (`gitlab` or `github`). When you pick
`github`, set these secrets (Settings → Secrets):

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — PAT used to create the repo via the GitHub API.
- `GITHUB_SSH_KEY` — private key registered on the target GitHub account (the dump is pushed over SSH).
- `GITHUB_ORG` *(optional)* — if set, repos are created under this org; otherwise your personal account is used.

## Main Scripture Credit

As mentioned above, this toolkit is entirely focused on improving the Original Firmware Dumper available:  [Dumpyara](https://github.com/AndroidDumps/) [Phoenix Firmware Dumper](https://github.com/DroidDumps)

Credit for those tools goes to everyone whosoever worked hard to put all those programs in one place to make an awesome project.
